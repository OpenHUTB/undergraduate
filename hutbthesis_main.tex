% https://www.zhihu.com/question/29413517/answer/44358389 %
% 说明如下：
% secnumdepth 这个计数器是 LaTeX 标准文档类用来控制章节编号深度的。
% 在 article 中，这个计数器的值默认是 3，对应的章节命令是 \subsubsection。
% 也就是说，默认情况下，article 将会对 \subsubsection 及其之上的所有章节标题进行编号，也就是 \part, \section, \subsection, \subsubsection。LaTeX 标准文档类中，最大的标题是 \part。它在 book 和 report 类中的层级是「-1」，在 article 类中的层级是「0」。这里，我们在调用 \appendix 的时候将计数器设置为 -2，因此所有的章节命令都不会编号了。不过，一般还是会保留 \part 的编号的。所以在实际使用中，将它设置为 0 就可以了。

% 在修改过程中请注意不要破环命令的完整性

% \renewcommand\appendix{\setcounter{secnumdepth}{-2}}
\appendix
\include{content/appendix}
